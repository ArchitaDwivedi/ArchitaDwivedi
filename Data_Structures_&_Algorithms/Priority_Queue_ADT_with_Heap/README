Implementing a Priority Queue ADT using heap and applications in service sector simulation.

Description:
This program implements a Priority Queue ADT using heap. The application is a standard and generic logistics/supply chain where we have stochastic arrival of items (like packages at a USPS store or people arriving at a vaccine center) subject to capacity constraints. We will simulate this process and look into how a standard queue and priority queue would differ in terms of maximizing payoff subject to time constraints.


Assuming the following input from a file (these are parameters used in the simulator):

  10
  3
  11
  5
  30
The output of the program would be:
  Average payoff of processed items after 30 time periods using Queue is: 4.000000 
  Average payoff of processed items after 30 time periods using Priority Queue is: 6.357143  


Example 2:
15
3
20
5
30
would result:
Average payoff of processed items after 30 time periods using Queue is: 8.250000
Average payoff of processed items after 30 time periods using Priority Queue is: 11.166667


Example 3:
15
3
20
5
1000
would result:
Average payoff of processed items after 1000 time periods using Queue is: 7.664634
Average payoff of processed items after 1000 time periods using Priority Queue is: 7.960366
