Implement Dictionary ADT with Hash Tables and an Enrollment application that uses these.

Description:
Our Dictionary ADT is responsible for managing data elements which are going to be key:value pairs. Keys will be unique while values could contain more information associated with the key. There are two parts in this program:
an implementor for Dictionary ADT's, and
an implementor of application which will use the Dictionaries via the provided interfaces.


The application is going to be a mini-enrollment system that maintains 2 dictionaries:-
1. A dictionary of courses. 
2. A dictionary of students. 

The course dictionary uses course IDs as keys and values include information about a course. The student dictionary uses student IDs as keys and values will include information about a student.







Assume the following input:-


ac CS101 10			// adds a new course CS101 with capacity 10
ac CS160 5			// adds a new course CS160 with capacity 5
en 12345 CS101 student_1	// enrolls student_1 into CS101
ac EE123 5			// adds a new course EE123 with capacity 5
en 23456 CS101 student_2	// enrolls student_2 into CS101
en 23456 EE123 student_2	// enrolls student_2 into EE123
en 23456 CS160 student_2	// enrolls student_2 into CS160, should produce error message
pc				// prints course capacities and enrollment
en 12345 CS160 student_1	// enrolls student_1 into CS160
en 34567 CS160 student_3	// enrolls student_3 into CS160
en 45678 CS160 student_4	// enrolls student_4 into CS160, should produce error message
dc EE123 x			// deletes EE123
dr 34567 CS160 student_3	// drops 34567 from CS160
en 34567 EE123 student_3	// enrolls student_3 into EE123, should produce error message
pc				// prints course capacities and enrollment
ps				// prints students enrolled in classes
ex				// exit




The output is as follows:-


Adding course: CS101
Adding course: CS160
Enrolling student: 12345 into course: CS101
Adding student: 12345
