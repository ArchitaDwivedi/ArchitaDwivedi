# To run this code file:-
-> First make sure all files are in the same folder.

-> Next go to your cmd/terminal, then using that go to the directory where you have stored these files and then use command ‘make’ on your terminal/cmd.

-> Next you will see a file named ‘tower’ in your directory.

-> From your cmd/terminal, run this file in the following manner:-

	tower -s -r
	
	or

	tower -s -n 4


-> Here -s is the game solution using ‘stacks’
-r is the game solution using ‘recursion’

And the -n parameter is to specify how many disks you want in the game.
